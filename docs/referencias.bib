	abstract = {We investigate the effect of corporate sustainability on analysts' forecast accuracy. Specifically, this paper documents how financial analysts respond to environmental, social and governance factors (hereinafter ESG) in earnings forecasts. Using a novel dataset from the Bloomberg ESG ratings, we find that ESG ratings increase analysts' forecast accuracy by reducing information risks and operation risks. The results are robust to a series of robustness checks, including propensity score matching, Heckman two-stage estimation, staggered difference-in-differences (DID), placebo test, firm and year fixed effects and alternative proxies. The effect of ESG ratings on analysts' forecast accuracy is more pronounced for firms audited by accounting firms with low industry expertise and for firms tracked by analysts with low industry expertise. This paper responds to the calls for more research on ESG ratings and analysts' earnings forecast accuracy and provides implications that ESG assurance can effectively improve the quality of nonfinancial information of a company. In addition, the paper is valuable for policymakers to improve the ESG disclosure system.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, companies have come under pressure to be socially conscious and environmentally responsible, with the pressure coming sometimes from politicians, regulators, and interest groups, and sometimes from investors. The argument that corporate managers should replace their singular focus on shareholders with a broader vision, where they also serve other stakeholders, including customers, employees, and society, has found a receptive audience with corporate CEOs and institutional investors. The pitch that companies should focus on doing good is sweetened with the promise that it will also be good for their bottom line and for shareholders. In this article, we build a framework for value that will allow us to examine how being socially responsible can manifest in the tangible ingredients of value and look at the evidence for whether being socially responsible is creating value for companies and for investors.
TOPIC: ESG investing


Key Findings
• For ESG to increase company value, actions taken to improve ESG ratings have to result in either higher cash flows or lower risk, and there is the very real possibility that being good can lower value for some firms.• The evidence that being good improves a company’s operating performance (increases cashflows) is weak but there is more solid backing for the proposition that being bad can make funding more expensive (higher costs of equity and debt).• Investing in companies that are recognized by the market as good companies is likely to decrease, rather than increase, investor returns, but investing in companies that are good, before the market recognizes and prices in the goodness, has a much better chance of success.},
